The possibilities are literally limitless.\n\nTo run a JavasScript function with content of block:\n- context menu: `Run` / `Run function with block content`\n- command palette: `Run function with block content`\n- pick a function from the list\n\nTo run a JavasScript function with selection:\n- context menu: `Run` / `Run function with selection`\n- command palette: `Run function with selection`\n- pick a function from the list\n\nIf you want to see all built-in functions use:\n- context menu: `Run`, `Show built-in functions`\n- command palette: `Shw built-in functions`\n"
